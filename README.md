# Bayesian Data Analysis for Crossover-Design Experiments

This repository contains the replication package of the study, where we investigate how Bayesian data analysis (including Bayesian modeling) can address threats to validity of experiments using a crossover design at analysis time.

## Structure

This repository contains the following items:

* src/ : directory for all code and scripts
  * `simulation.Rmd` : simulation of our hypotheses with a synthetic data set
  * `reproduction.Rmd` : reproduction of the study by Vegas et al.[^1]
